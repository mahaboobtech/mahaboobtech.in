If you want to maintain a good, healthy relationship, then this article is for you, especially for introverts who are hesitant to talk.

## Feeling of Introverts
Introverts in relationships often face difficulties maintaining connections. Especially in boyfriend-girlfriend relationships, they tend to stay silent and not talk much. However, they wish they could be like Remo in the movie Aparichith. Introverts often rely on facial expressions; they don't talk much but instead observe others and stay silent, which leads to their behavior going unrecognized. Eventually, people don't prioritize them, and when they try to engage with their girlfriend/boyfriend, they are often left behind, which is very painful for introverts.

## Why Introverts Behave Like That
Well, there may be several factors, depending on the person:
1. **Overthinking**: They may worry excessively about what others think of them.
2. **Lack of Communication Skills**: Communicating in a particular language is one thing, but knowing what to communicate is another. There should be a good listener who understands feelings and knows what and when to speak.
3. **Fear**: They might actually be good communicators, but their emotions control them.
4. **Other Factors**: The situation they are living in can control them and instill fear. It is difficult to generalize everyone, and these are not the only factors that contribute to being an introvert; there may be different factors.

## How to Maintain a Good Relationship
### Personal Story
I want to share my personal story was an introvert. I had four good friends: Apple, Lilly, Rinbar, and Pimple. We were good friends who used to share things and message on social media. I was very excited about that friendship. Despite being an introvert, I was very attached to them, and they also developed a decent friendship with me. However, I was overly excited about it.

As time went on, a small fight occurred between me and my friends over a minor issue, which could have been resolved in minutes. But, being an introvert, I remained silent. Over time, Apple and Lilly secretly became a couple, which I noticed from their behavior in public. I was happy for them, but the issue between us remained unresolved. As usual, I didn't talk to them and kept calm. Eventually, the small issue escalated, and Apple strongly alleged that I was a threat to them. The situation worsened. When I finally tried to solve it, the trust had already evaporated. They kept me at a distance and maintained secret chats without me. When I realized they were excluding me, it was incredibly painful because of the expectations I had grown. I distanced myself from them, but there was still a small amount of affection between us.

After a few days, the same issue resurfaced, and they presented weak evidence against me, which they misunderstood. They blamed me without any strong proof. I was shocked and, as usual, didn't try to convince them or solve the issue. I just let it be. I didn't want to talk to them anymore and was very distressed because I knew they would never believe me again. After this incident, not only I but they were also sad and angry about it. As I cried, they cried too. Later, I started thinking about why this had to happen. Then I realized that I didn't communicate with them well and didn't try to solve the issue.

### Moral of the Story
Communication is key. We need to keep communicating with people while maintaining our privacy. They should feel like this person is okay and welcome in their lives. Relationships require time to build a strong bond. We need to start slowly and then give a push to strengthen the bond.

### Introvert Tips
Introverts are special beings in the universe. They keep things inside and focus highly on what they want, but keeping so much inside can lead to an emotional outburst one day. I recommend:
1. Joining a community
2. Improving communication skills
3. Spending at least 5 minutes a day in public
4. Socializing by helping people, participating in events, talking in public, or engaging in group discussions

All you need to do is go with the flow.
