In this article what ever i give the information is based on my personal experience so i think my personal setup may help you guys thats why i recommend you to use this setup 

i am taking what ever your requirement wise that you will use in your daily drive

## why need to documentation 
first of all why we need to document something, well small kind of things will doesnt matter but when it comes to like making a project or gathering some big data or learning something and you opened it again and you will know that you have forgotten that thing which you were fantastic at that thing few months back or few years back, you may have get this kind of problem in your life right? , so yes documentation or writing stuff is very important to quick start or move faster on something 

## type of data want to store

1. simple words 
2. book type with basic tools (medium)
3. data normalization with infinite possibilities (advance) 

lets start with simple things 
## simple
so if your using the data like just number or writing a script of just the store things like a note pad then the best way to use software is [google keep](https://keep.google.com/) or [evernote](https://evernote.com/) well this are very good for basic note taking it is multi device support also you that you can use in your laptop or mobile device or pc etc 
and the fun feature is google keep has drawing thing which is nasty but yes for basic thing 

## book type( medium level)
if you need some tool for storing the data like a book type where your writing the notes or dairy or writing the cinema stories or inserting study materials of class room or  college or school and also having the options like bold inserting table bullets all the basic stuff you do in ms word then this one for you [onenote](https://www.onenote.com/) this is best thing i ever seen until now 
one note offers sections and pages just like your writing the book on physical note book  this is a great note book you have to try i think there is [notion](https://www.notion.so/) which is advance than the one note but it is little difficult to use this so i recommend you to use onenote which is smash! love it 

## advance level 
your kind of person like professional or your a cybersecurity guy or your a software developer that you need so many options so that you can increase your productivity , todo list , insert location, images , tables, tags , mapping the files in graphical view whatever in your mind, you have endless and that tool is 
[obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) 
this tool is having all the features your looking for yes i just over hyped this tool , yes this is because its community plugins , just install the plugins what ever feature you want and then use it 
it is markdown file where you need to have basic idea about markdown once you get into this it just a productivity thing here ctrl + p is the command palette which helps you to put bold or table into your markdown file and you need get around into it so that you can expand your usage level 
over all the obsidian is the best thing because its features, plugins, and community 

## opinion 
the main point here is you need to decide which level i am and what i want to store the data , so think wisely before getting into the software that you wanted and increase your productivity all my intension is to help you guys with my experience thank you for reading.
