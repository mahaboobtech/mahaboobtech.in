# Who am I?
## Briefly about me
Hi, this is Shaik Mahaboob Basha. You can call me Bs or Basha, as you like.
I am a B.Tech graduate who loves to explore tech things. I just forget about myself when I work on technical things, and I love to explore mainly operating systems, coding, and designing circuits. Sometimes my interest expands to various things, but mostly I love to do technical stuff like Iron Man. Love you 3000 âŽŠ

## About blogs
When I talk about my blogs, I talk about my personal interests, which not everyone will like, but it will definitely be something interesting.

## Future updates
There will definitely be big updates soon. Whether it's a failure or a success, the updates will be on this website.

Thank you for your support, and please understand that the Google ads are to help the content creator run the website and for future upgrades.

## love you 3000!
