Especially in boyfriend-girlfriend relationships, they tend to stay silent and not talk much. However, they wish they could be like Remo in the movie Aparichith. Introverts often rely on facial expressions; they don\u0026rsquo;t talk much but instead observe others and stay silent, which leads to their behavior going unrecognized. Eventually, people don\u0026rsquo;t prioritize them, and when they try to engage with their girlfriend/boyfriend, they are often left behind, which is very painful for introverts.\nWhy Introverts Behave Like That #Well, there may be several factors, depending on the person:\nOverthinking: They may worry excessively about what others think of them. Lack of Communication Skills: Communicating in a particular language is one thing, but knowing what to communicate is another. There should be a good listener who understands feelings and knows what and when to speak. Fear: They might actually be good communicators, but their emotions control them. Other Factors: The situation they are living in can control them and instill fear. It is difficult to generalize everyone, and these are not the only factors that contribute to being an introvert; there may be different factors. How to Maintain a Good Relationship #Personal Story #I want to share my personal story was an introvert. I had four good friends: Apple, Lilly, Rinbar, and Pimple. We were good friends who used to share things and message on social media. I was very excited about that friendship. Despite being an introvert, I was very attached to them, and they also developed a decent friendship with me. However, I was overly excited about it.\nAs time went on, a small fight occurred between me and my friends over a minor issue, which could have been resolved in minutes. But, being an introvert, I remained silent. Over time, Apple and Lilly secretly became a couple, which I noticed from their behavior in public. I was happy for them, but the issue between us remained unresolved. As usual, I didn\u0026rsquo;t talk to them and kept calm. Eventually, the small issue escalated, and Apple strongly alleged that I was a threat to them. The situation worsened. When I finally tried to solve it, the trust had already evaporated. They kept me at a distance and maintained secret chats without me. When I realized they were excluding me, it was incredibly painful because of the expectations I had grown. I distanced myself from them, but there was still a small amount of affection between us.\nAfter a few days, the same issue resurfaced, and they presented weak evidence against me, which they misunderstood. They blamed me without any strong proof. I was shocked and, as usual, didn\u0026rsquo;t try to convince them or solve the issue. I just let it be. I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to talk to them anymore and was very distressed because I knew they would never believe me again. After this incident, not only I but they were also sad and angry about it. As I cried, they cried too. Later, I started thinking about why this had to happen. Then I realized that I didn\u0026rsquo;t communicate with them well and didn\u0026rsquo;t try to solve the issue.\nMoral of the Story #Communication is key. We need to keep communicating with people while maintaining our privacy. They should feel like this person is okay and welcome in their lives. Relationships require time to build a strong bond. We need to start slowly and then give a push to strengthen the bond.\nIntrovert Tips #Introverts are special beings in the universe. They keep things inside and focus highly on what they want, but keeping so much inside can lead to an emotional outburst one day. I recommend:\nJoining a community Improving communication skills Spending at least 5 minutes a day in public Socializing by helping people, participating in events, talking in public, or engaging in group discussions All you need to do is go with the flow.\n","date":"1 October 2024","permalink":"/offtopic/relationship/","section":"","summary":"If you want to maintain a good, healthy relationship, then this article is for you, especially for introverts who are hesitant to talk.\nFeeling of Introverts #Introverts in relationships often face difficulties maintaining connections.

(3 bytes + length of name + 2 bytes newline) TEL:\u0026lt;phone number\u0026gt; (4 bytes + length of phone number + 2 bytes newline) END:VCARD (11 bytes + 2 bytes newline) Putting It All Together:\nBEGIN:VCARD: 13 bytes VERSION:3.0: 11 bytes FN:\u0026lt;name\u0026gt;: 3 bytes + length of \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; + 2 bytes newline TEL:\u0026lt;phone number\u0026gt;: 4 bytes + length of \u0026lt;phone number\u0026gt; + 2 bytes newline END:VCARD: 13 bytes (11 bytes for END:VCARD + 2 bytes newline) Summing these, assuming \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;phone number\u0026gt; are relatively short:\nBEGIN:VCARD: 13 bytes VERSION:3.0: 11 bytes FN:\u0026lt;name\u0026gt;: Approx. 3 bytes + length of \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; + 2 bytes TEL:\u0026lt;phone number\u0026gt;: Approx. 4 bytes + length of \u0026lt;phone number\u0026gt; + 2 bytes END:VCARD: 13 bytes Total Approximation:\nWithout \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;phone number\u0026gt;, it’s around 13 + 11 + 13 + 13 = 50 bytes Add length of \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;phone number\u0026gt; plus their newlines For a rough estimate, assume a short name (e.g., 1 byte) and phone number (e.g., 10 bytes):\nPer vCard Entry: 50 bytes + 1 byte (name) + 10 bytes (phone) + 4 bytes (newlines) = 65 bytes (approx.) then total 4 billion number for each it takes 65 (approx.) then 65 x 4 billion 2,60,00,00,00,000 bytes in GB it will be 2,47,955.322265625 which is approx. 248 GB or 246 GB it may differ according to data but in worst case we can assume 248 GB now you told it going to batches then how much a file will contain and how many files will be there Certainly! Let’s calculate everything based on number of phone numbers, which is 4 billion.\n1. Total Number of vCards\nPhone Numbers: 4,000,000,000 2. Size of Each File\nAssuming you generate files with 100,000 vCards each:\nNumber of vCards per File: 100,000 Size per vCard: 65 bytes Size of Each File:\n$$ \\text{Size of Each File} = \\text{Number of vCards per File} \\times \\text{Size per vCard} = 100,000 \\times 65 \\text{ bytes} = 6,500,000 \\text{ bytes} $$\nConvert to megabytes:\n$$ \\text{Size of Each File} = \\frac{6,500,000 \\text{ bytes}}{1024 \\times 1024} \\approx 6.2 \\text{ MB} $$ 3.

Total File Size\nTotal Size of All Files: $$ \\text{Total File Size} = \\text{Number of Files} \\times \\text{Size of Each File} = 40,000 \\times 6.2 \\text{ MB} = 248,000 \\text{ MB} $$\nConvert to gigabytes:\n$$ \\text{Total File Size} = \\frac{248,000 \\text{ MB}}{1024} \\approx 242.2 \\text{ GB} $$\nso how much time it going to take Estimated Time to Process as i have small computer so yes 4 cores !

To a newbie, it might seem like just an operating system, but technically, it\u0026rsquo;s a kernel. Now, what is a kernel? You might wonder. In a nutshell, it acts as a bridge between hardware and software. Yes, Linux is a kernel created by Sir Linus Torvalds.\nThere were a few software projects like GNU and other open-source software. When combined with the Linux kernel, they form the complete operating system. This OS is open source, so many developers rapidly integrated their own open-source software with the Linux kernel, resulting in distributions like Ubuntu, Kali Linux, Garuda OS, Parrot OS, etc.\nIn the market, regardless of how many distributions appear, they all fall under the common name: a Linux OS.\nTypes of Linux OS #In the market, there are several distros, but they can generally be categorized into four:\nDebian Arch Red Hat SUSE Remember these major distros because many others you see, like Ubuntu and Kali, are derived from Debian, and others are based on one of these.\n\u0026ldquo;Derived\u0026rdquo; means they use the code and modify the software according to their preferences.\nDo I Use Linux OS? #Well, it depends on your usage. Let me tell you a few advantages and disadvantages:\nAdvantages # Faster than Windows Feels cool A lot of customization options Best for coding and software developers Basic gaming capabilities natively; better with a high-end PC Requires fewer resources to run Environmentally friendly OS that you can install on an old computer High security Disadvantages # Not the best for gaming, though still viable Lack of daily use software like Adobe, MS Office, Final Cut Pro Difficult to configure; you need great skills to tweak the settings My Opinion #Linux is a superb OS for me. I like its responsiveness; it\u0026rsquo;s noticeably faster than Windows from the moment you start using it. Linux has made my coding life much easier because fixing library problems or related software for building applications is straightforward. For example, while building software like Pix2Tex, it required certain pip libraries that are difficult to install on Windows, but on Linux, you can install them with a simple command in the terminal.\nMy bad experiences were with gaming and the lack of MS Office, but I manage with LibreOffice and WPS Office, which are quite good alternatives.\nThe great thing about Linux is that you can install software using a simple command in the terminal, managed by a package manager.\nsudo apt install nano My Distro Recommendations #If you\u0026rsquo;re a newbie looking to try Linux, Ubuntu is the best choice because it includes all major drivers, reducing issues like WiFi not working properly. Recent versions of Linux also have a feel similar to macOS.\nNext, the Parrot OS desktop version is excellent for daily use.\nAfterward, you can try Linux Mint or Garuda OS, among others.\nHowever, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t recommend Debian or Arch Linux unless you know what you\u0026rsquo;re doing; they\u0026rsquo;re more advanced and require greater expertise.\nForums specific to each distro exist, where you can seek help if any errors occur.\n","date":"21 June 2024","permalink":"/tech/os/what_is_linux/","section":"","summary":"What is Linux? #Linux is an operating system. To a newbie, it might seem like just an operating system, but technically, it\u0026rsquo;s a kernel. Now, what is a kernel? You might wonder. In a nutshell, it acts as a bridge between hardware and software. Yes, Linux is a kernel created by Sir Linus Torvalds.\nThere were a few software projects like GNU and other open-source software.
